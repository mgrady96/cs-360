**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**<br />
The application that I developed is an inventory tracking application. The user need this was created to address was the need to have an easy way to track what was in stock and send notifications when stock was low. <br/>
<br />
**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**<br />
There were several screens featured in the UI. Some of those include a login screen, a screen with a grid and inventory information, and a communication preference page. The communication preference page allowed users to sign up to recieve notifications via text and/or email for when items were low in stock. I kept the users needs in mind by making sure the layout was simple and intuitive so there was no confusion while using the app.  <br/>
<br />
**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**<br />
I followed the requirements listed and coded the app to those specifications. This is important because whenever you're programming anything you have to make sure you're following whatever requirements are presented. <br/>
<br />
**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**<br />
Testing code to make sure it is functional is extremely important. Defects can cost a lot of extra time and labor. I always make sure to test my code thoroughly to ensure as few defects as possible are present. One of the main ways that I tested this application was using the emulator in Android studio to ensure the application functioned correctly on a mobile device. <br/>
<br />
**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**<br />
In this application I had to use my debugging skills in order to figure out some challenging error messages and compile issues. I used my resources to see what possible solutions there were to each error and then altered the lines causing the errors. <br/>
<br />
**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**<br />
I think that for this application, I did a good job showcasing my skills designing the UI. I worked to keep the user in mind and ensure that had an easy experience using the application. <br/>
